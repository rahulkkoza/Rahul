Assignment 

1.	Write a program which takes a tuple as an input and remove the first and last element from the tuple. And returns a tuple as an output. (hint: convert the tuple into a list)

tup = tuple(input("enter tuple"))
print(tup)
lis = list(tup) 
del lis[0] 
del lis[-1]
tup = tuple(lis)
print(tup)


2.	Given a list of numbers, determine the odd and even numbers from the list and print 2 separate list of numbers.
              
              lis1=list(map(int,input('Enter elements of List: ').split()))
              EvenList=[]
               OddList=[]
               for j in lis1:
                      if j%2==0:
                        EvenList.append(j)
                       else:
                        OddList.append(j)
        print('List of even number: ',EvenList)
        print('List of odd number: ',OddList)


3.	Given a Python list, remove all occurrence of 20 from the list : list1 = [5, 20, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]


            list1 = [5, 20, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]
           def rem(sampleList, val):
           return [value for value in sampleList if value != val]
          resList = rem(list1, 20)
           print(resList)

4.	Take 2 lists and create a dictionary with one list being the keys other being values.
            test_keys = ["Sam", "Jenny", "Sachin"] 
             test_values = [1, 2, 3] 
            print ("Key list is : " + str(test_keys)) 
             print ("Value list is : " + str(test_values)) 
            res = dict(zip(test_keys, test_values)) 
            print ("Resulting dictionary is : " +  str(res)

5.	Take a paragraph as an input and store each word into a set and print the number of unique words. (Hint: use split method to convert each word into an item in a list)


           def main():
                p = input("Enter your sentence: ")
               words = p.split(" ")
               print("the words are ",words)
               wordCount = len(words)
               print ("The word count is:", wordCount)
            main()
